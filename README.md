## 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

My first accessibility challenge on the GitHub repo! It is aimed at honing the skills required to deliver on-the-job tasks. The main focus is refactoring the starter code with semantic tags so that it boosts SEO, is highly accessible, and provides user-friendly digital experiences. #AccessibilityChallenge #WebDevelopment #InclusiveDesign

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this by completing the following:

-   Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
-   HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-   Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
-   Heading attributes fall in sequential order
-   Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
